For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section "The impact of hierarchical rank on speakers’ acoustic cues."

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> The impact of hierarchical rank on speakers’ acoustic
cues. Each of the six hierarchy-based (i.e., postmanipulation)
acoustic variables was submitted to a 2
(condition: high rank, low rank) × 2 (speaker’s sex:
female, male) between-subjects analysis of covariance,
controlling for the corresponding baseline acoustic variable.
Table 4 presents the adjusted means by condition.
Condition had a significant effect on pitch, pitch variability,
and loudness variability. Speakers’ voices in the
high-rank condition had higher pitch, F(1, 156) = 4.48,
p < .05; were more variable in loudness, F(1, 156) = 4.66,
p < .05; and were more monotone (i.e., less variable in
pitch), F(1, 156) = 4.73, p < .05, compared with speakers’
voices in the low-rank condition (all other Fs < 1; see
the Supplemental Material for additional analyses of covariance involving pitch and loudness).

**Note**
Make sure to use the original article for additional context and information about any necessary pre-processing steps. Also check for additional supplementary materials that may provide supporting documentation for analysis procedures.
